## Network Design Diagrams and Justifications
- Core Switching and Routing:
Implement a robust core switching and routing infrastructure to handle the traffic between different geographical locations and provide connectivity to the internet.
Use high-performance switches with sufficient port density and layer 3 routing capabilities to support the network traffic.
Employ redundant core switches for high availability and fault tolerance.
- Distribution Switches:
Deploy distribution switches at each geographical location to aggregate the traffic from access switches and provide connectivity to the core switches.
Use stackable switches for scalability and ease of management.
Ensure sufficient uplink capacity to connect to the core switches.
- Access Switches:
Install access switches in each office or building to connect end-user devices, IP cameras, and other peripherals.
Utilize Power over Ethernet (PoE) switches to power IP cameras and wireless access points.
Implement VLANs to logically segment the network and improve security and performance.
- Wireless Network:
Deploy wireless access points (WAPs) throughout each office or building to provide wireless connectivity to users and customers.
Use enterprise-grade WAPs that support the latest Wi-Fi standards for optimal performance and security.
Implement a secure authentication mechanism such as WPA2-Enterprise or 802.1X for user authentication.
- Internet Connectivity:
Establish redundant internet connections with failover capabilities to ensure continuous internet access for users and customers.
Implement firewalls and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to protect against cyber threats and unauthorized access.
Consider implementing content filtering to restrict access to inappropriate websites and improve network security.
- VPN Connectivity:
Set up virtual private network (VPN) connections between different geographical locations to securely connect remote offices and users.
Use VPN encryption protocols such as IPSec or SSL/TLS to protect data transmitted over the VPN connections.
- Data Center:
Design and build a dedicated data center to host servers, including the web server and other critical applications.
Implement redundant power supplies, cooling systems, and network connectivity to ensure high availability and reliability.
Utilize server virtualization technology to optimize resource utilization and simplify management.
- Monitoring and Management:
Deploy network monitoring tools to continuously monitor the health and performance of the network infrastructure.
Implement network management systems for centralized configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
Regularly update and patch network devices to address security vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with industry standards.
